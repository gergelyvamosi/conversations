  you can also test with two different users in a firefox and a chrome browser on one machine. just chat 1on1s on one computer.



## KNOWN bugs

* data refresh (lists) goes on client side not all the time - mostly on second click works :) (possibly using effects is to d≈ëlve). the implementation of the functionality the original specification is at 97%. completion is at almost 100%. some bugs still in.
* cookie JSESSIONID gets stuck on tomcat - no logout implemented - clear cookies in browser if use a different user : !! UPDATE 2025-05-17 19:30 logout() added !!


## to complete the task was totally 4 days 33hrs,

* 1st day considerations / concept of the development 4 hrs,

* 2nd day implementation spring boot JAVA 17 / business layer / mysql db 10 hrs,

* 3rd day implementation Angular 19 client 11hrs

* 4th day implementation Angular 19 client, misc, debug, fine tune 7hrs + 1hr logout
